            <h3>Frenchies City is a recognized Make-A-Wish national partner</h3>
            <p>Dogs & puppies have a positive impact on human lives. This has been the driving motivation behind
                our Frenchies City Gives Back program. Animals improve the quality of life and mental health of
                their
                human companions.
                <br>
                Frenchies City places puppies through non-profit organizations for individuals and families who can
                positively be impacted by a new addition. Since 2018 Frenchies City has partnered with the
                Make-A-Wish Foundation to deliver happiness into children’s lives.

            <h3>Members of the Frenchies City team volunteer at their local shelter</h3>
            <p>Frenchies City was founded on the philosophy that dogs improve the quality of people’s lives. That has
                evolved to go deeper into our community. Members of the Frenchies City team are encouraged to volunteer
                together quarterly at their local humane society or shelter. We organize these efforts as a team to
                help ensure every dog finds a loving home while strengthening the bonds between our employees and
                community.

            <h3>Frenchies City runs a national program to find homes for retired breeding dogs</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                As a part of our commitment to each of the pups, customers, and breeders we work with, and to the
                humane treatment of all dogs, Frenchies City offers a re-homing option for retired breeding dogs.
                These
                dogs have previously been bred, have been spayed or neutered, and are well socialized with puppies,
                other dogs, and people.
