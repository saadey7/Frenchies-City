            <br>
            <h1>The Health of Your Puppy is Our Primary Concern</h1>
            <br>
            <p>It all starts with choosing our breeders. We carefully screen our breeders and only work with those
                who meet our industry-leading standards. Once a breeder has been accepted into our community, we
                continue to ensure that they are raising healthy puppies by requiring comprehensive health
                evaluations for every puppy they place through Frenchies City.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <h1>Comprehensive Health Evaluations</h1>
            <p>Each breeder is required to keep their puppies up-to-date on all vaccinations and deworming. Every
                puppy must pass a comprehensive nose-to-tail health evaluation by the breeder’s licensed
                veterinarian before they travel home to their new families. The results of this health evaluation
                are reported through our mandatory Veterinary Health Report (VHR).</p>
            <br>
            <p>Certified by a third-party, licensed veterinarian, the VHR requires an examination of a puppy’s ears,
                eyes, mouth, teeth, gums, respiratory system, cardiovascular system, musculoskeletal system, skin
                and coat, gastrointestinal system, and external genitalia. We also strongly encourage new puppy
                owners to take their puppy to the vet as close to arrival as safely possible. Your new pup will have
                just changed environments from breeder to your home, and getting a checkup right away helps to
                ensure that change goes as smoothly as possible.</p>

            <h4>All pups come with our industry-leading 10-year health commitment.</h4>
            <br>
            <h1>Our Health Commitment</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                Before bringing a puppy home, it’s important to know that owning a puppy means frequent visits to a
                veterinarian and that you will be responsible for all costs associated with such veterinarian
                visits.
                <br>
                We do everything we can to make sure your puppy is as healthy as possible when she arrives, but
                puppies are living breathing animals which means health issues do arise despite our best efforts.

            <h4>What does the Frenchies City commitment cover?</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Our commitment covers health issues that may arise after the arrival of your puppy. This commitment
                only covers puppies who are delivered [and have continually resided] within the United States and/or
                Canada.</p>
